## Definition

Dependency Inversion Principle states that a higher level object should never depend on a concrete implementation of a lower-level object. Both should depend on abstractions.


	One should â€œdepend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.

using interfaces is the best way to approach the DIP. 
	. interfaces are more flexible, more powerful, and better suited to design contracts.



## obs

- abstract classes are also abstractions, but you should depend on interfaces whenever 
possible instead.
	An abstract class is an abstraction but is not 100% abstract
	Abstract classes are used to encapsulate default behaviors that you can then inherit in sub-classes N
