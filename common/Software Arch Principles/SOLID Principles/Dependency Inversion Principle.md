## Definition

Dependency Inversion Principle states that a higher level object should never depend on a concrete implementation of a lower-level object. Both should depend on abstractions.


	One should “depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.

using interfaces is the best way to approach the DIP. 



## obs

- abstract classes are also abstractions, but you should depend on interfaces whenever 
possible instead.
	An abstract class is an abstraction but is not 100% 
abstract, and if it is, you should replace it with an interface. 
Abstract classes are used to encapsulate default behaviors that you can then inherit in sub-classes. They are helpful, but interfaces are more 
flexible, more powerful, and better suited to design contracts. N
