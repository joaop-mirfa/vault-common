#SOLID 

## Definition

Open-Closed Principle states that every 

Class should be responsible for only one specific functionality

Each of these components is atomic (unsplittable), self-contained and can be easily replaced


	Software entities (classes, modules, functions, and so on) should be open for extension    but closed for modification
		 Bertrand Meyer, 1988
