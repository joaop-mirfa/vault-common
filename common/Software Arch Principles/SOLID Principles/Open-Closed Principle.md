#SOLID 

## Definition

Open-Closed Principle states that every atomic unit of code should be open for extension, but closed for modification

This says that unit code need be unchangeable, unless some erros are detected in it. If future requirements changed or expanded, this code can add new functionality

	Software entities (classes, modules, functions, and so on) should be open for extension    but closed for modification
		 Bertrand Meyer, 1988
