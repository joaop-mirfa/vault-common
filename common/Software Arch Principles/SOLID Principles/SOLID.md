#ArchiteturalPrinciples

Is acronym for some principles that extend the basic OOP concepts:
	- Abstraction
	- Encapsulation
	- Inheritance
	- Polymorphism

Originally compiled by Robert C. Martin in the 1990s, 

these principles provide a clear pathway for moving from tightly coupled code with poor cohesion and little encapsulation to the desired results of loosely coupled code, operating very cohesively and encapsulating the real needs of the business appropriately.

Being familiar with this principles these principles will make you more effective, and important part to fully understand design patterns

The **SOLID** design principles help us create maintainable, reusable, and flexible software designs.

This principles is not rules to follow at all cost, you dont use Solid principles always

The principles are:

- [[Single Reponsibility Principle]]
- [[Open-Closed Principle]]
- [[Liskov Substitution Principle]]
- [[Interface Segregation Principle]]
- [[Dependency Inversion Principle]]
