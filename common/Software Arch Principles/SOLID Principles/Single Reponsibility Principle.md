#SOLID 

## Definition

Single responibility principle states that, for every self-containes unit of code (like class) there should be one and only one reason to change (had only a single responsibility)

Class should be responsible for only one specific functionality

Each of these components is atomic (unsplittable), self-contained and can be easily replaced


	There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.
		 Robert C. Martin
